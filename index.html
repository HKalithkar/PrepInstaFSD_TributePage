                    Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the 
                    fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar of the Pune district. Shivaji's father 
                    Shahaji was in service of the Bijapuri Sultanate - a tripartite association between 
                    Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. He also owned a Jaigirdari near Pune. 
                    Shivaji's mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader Lakhujirao Jadhav and a 
                    deeply religious woman. Shivaji was especially close to his mother who instilled in him 
                    a strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji spent most of his time outside of Pune, 
                    the responsibility of overseeing Shivaji's education rested on the shoulders of a small 
                    council of ministers which included a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), 
                    a Sabnis (Raghunath Ballal), a Dabir (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). Kanhoji 
                    Jedhe and Baji Pasalkar were appointed to train Shivaji in military and martial arts. Shivaji 
                    was married to Saibai Nimbalkar in 1640.

                    Shivaji turned out to be a born leader from a very young age. An active outdoorsman, 
                    he explored the Sahayadri Mountains surrounding the Shivneri forts and came to know the area 
                    like the back of his hands. By the time he was 15, he had accumulated a band of faithful soldiers 
                    from the Maval region who later aided in his early conquests.

                    Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is 
                    considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits 
                    are narrated as a part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji 
                    carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the 
                    genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji implemented a competent and 
                    progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military and well-established administrative 
                    set-up. Shivaji is well-known for his innovative military tactics that centered around non-conventional 
                    methods leveraging strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.
